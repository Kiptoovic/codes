1. Journal on Activities Undertaken When Making Models of Plant and Animal Cells*<br />

*Date Started:* [Insert Date]  <br />
*Objective:* To create 3D models of plant and animal cells for better understanding of their structures.<br />

*Activities:*<br />
- Researched the structures of plant and animal cells under a light microscope.<br />
- Listed key organelles (e.g. nucleus, mitochondria, vacuole, cell membrane).<br />
- Collected materials (e.g. cardboard, clay, colored paper, glue, scissors).<br />
- Designed a rough sketch of each cell model.<br />
- Molded each organelle using clay and labeled them.<br />
- Assembled and arranged organelles inside the model layout.<br />
- Compared the final models with textbook diagrams.<br />
- Presented models and explained each part.<br />

2. How to Make a Model of Plant and Animal Cell (Light Microscope View)*<br />

*Plant Cell:*<br />
- Use a rectangular base for the cell wall.<br />
- Include a large central vacuole, chloroplasts, nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria.<br />
- Use green clay for chloroplasts and blue for vacuole.<br />

*Animal Cell:*<br />
- Use a round/oval base for cell membrane.<br />
- Include nucleus, mitochondria, cytoplasm, and smaller vacuoles.<br />
- No chloroplasts or cell wall.<br />

3. Short Notes: How to Make Models of Plant & Animal Cells (Light Microscope)*<br />

- *Materials Needed:* Clay, cardboard, glue, markers.<br />
- *Plant Cell:* Add cell wall, chloroplasts, and large vacuole.<br />
- *Animal Cell:* Round shape, no cell wall or chloroplasts.<br />
- *Label Organelles:* Nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondria, etc.<br />
- *Use color coding* for easy identification.<br />

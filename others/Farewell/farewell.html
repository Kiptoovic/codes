RE: COMMITMENT TO PAY SCHOOL FEES

I, Philip Koros, of National ID No. 12553838, the parent of Victor Kiptoo Koros, registration number C025-01-0860/2025, do hereby commit myself to pay the full school fees for the current semester.

I kindly request the University to allow my son to continue with his studies as I make the necessary financial arrangements. I undertake to clear the full balance of fees within one (1) month from today, that is on or before 28th September,2025.

I fully understand and accept that it is my responsibility to honor this commitment, and I assure you that the payment will be made within the agreed period.

Thank you for your kind consideration.

Yours faithfully,

Philip Koros
Parent

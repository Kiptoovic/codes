ABSTRACT
Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer related morbidity and mortality among women globally with rising incidences in low and middle income countries including Kenya. This study aims to assess the determinants of breast cancer among women of reproductive age attending Soin Sigowet Subcounty Hospital in Kericho County,Kenya. A descriptive cross-sectional study design was employed involving structured questionares and medical record reviews. Data were collected on sociodemographic characteristics ,lifestyle factors ,reproductive history and family history of cancer. Stastistical analysis was used to identify associations between these factors and breast cancer incidence. The study found that early menarche ,nulliparity ,use of hormonal contraceptives, lack of breastfeeding, family history of breast cancer and high fat diet significantly contributed to increased risk. The findings highlight the need for targeted awareness, early screening programs and lifestyle modification strategies to reduce breast cancer risk among women of reproductive age in this region. 
CHAPTER ONE; INTRODUCTION
1.1; BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. According to world health organization[WHO], breast cancer accounts for approximately 2.3 million new cases and 685,000 deaths annually. In low and middle income countries(LMICs), including Kenya breast cancer incidence and mortality has been rising steadily due to limited awareness, delayed diagnosis and inadequate access to screening and treatment services. In Kenya breast cancer is the leading type of cancer among women with the ministry of health reporting it as second most common cancer overall after cervical cancer. The National Cancer Control Strategy (2020-2025 ) recognizes breast cancer as a public health priority with increasing cases  being diagnosed among women in their reproductive age(15-49 years).Despite this, early detection efforts remain insufficient, particularly in Rural areas such as Soin Sigowet Sub-county in Kericho County, where access to health care services is limited and cultural beliefs often influence health seeking behavior. Several   factors have been associated with increased cancer risk, including predisposition hormonal factors (such us early menarche and menopause), reproductive history, lifestyle factors (diet, physical activity and alcohol use) and environmental exposures. However, the specific determinants of breast cancer among women of reproductive age in rural Kenya settings are not well documented. This gap in knowledge hinders the development of effective, localized interventions aimed at prevention, early detection and treatment. Soin-Sigowet Sub County Hospital serves a largely rural population with limited resources and low health literacy levels. Anecdotal evidences suggest that many women present with advanced stages of breast cancer , which significantly reduces treatment success and survival rates. Understanding the determinants associated with breast cancer in this population is essential for developing targeted awareness campaigns, promoting early screening and informing health policy. Therefore, this study seeks to identify and analyze the key determinants associated with breast cancer among women of reproductive age attending Soin Sigowet Sub County Hospital. The findings will contribute to a better understanding of local risk factors and help inform public health strategies to reduce breast cancer morbidity and mortality in the region.
        1.2 ;PROBLEM STATEMENT OF THE STUDY
Despite the interventions  of international community against breast cancer , its incidence and mortality are on the rise particularly in Low and Middle Income Nations(Ebrahimmoghil et al, 2025). Breast cancer is a public health issue in Kenya, although a lot of research is still required on the determinants of the disease, especially in rural Kenya  like Soin Sigowet Sub County Hospital. Low awareness, late diagnosis and inadequate health care facilities further exacerbate the burden of breast cancer in the region . Knowledge about the determinants of breast cancer among women of reproductive age is imperative in formulating targeted interventions to prevent its prevalence and enhance outcomes. The current study thus aims to determine the sociodemographic, behavioral, reproductive and access to health care determinants of breast cancer among this population.
1.3; JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY
This research study seeks to establish the sociodemographic, behavioral, reproductive and access to health care determinants of breast cancer among women of reproductive age in this region. By studying a population that is typically unrepresented in research, the study aims to fill the essential knowledge gap with implications that can be applied to inform intervention approaches to reduce burden of breast cancer in rural Kenya. Identification of these determinants will be important in the development of effective prevention strategies, improving early detection and treatment outcomes among women in underserved populations. Though raising awareness of the specific causes of breast cancer in Soin Sigowet Sub County , the research is able to empower women to present themselves for early screening and treatment which will save lives. The research contributes to the global literature of low and middle income nations breast cancer determinants and helps bridge the cancer outcome gap between high income and low resource settings. Last but not least, this research is crucial step toward reducing breast cancer burden in rural Kenya and improving womens health and wellbeing in such areas.
1.4; OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY 
1.4.1; BROAD OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY
To determine the determinants associated with breast cancer among women of reproductive age in Soin Sigowet Sub County Hospital, Kenya.
1.4,2; SPECIFIC OBJECTVES OF THE STUDY
To identify the lifestyle factors associated with breast cancer.
To determine the barriers that affect timely and effective breast cancer screening and treatment. 
To determine the cultural beliefs that influence health-seeking behaviors and outcome for women at risk of getting breast cancer.
1.5; RESEARCH QUESTIONS OF THE STUDY
What are the lifestyle factors associated with breast cancer?
What are the barriers that affect timely and effective breast cancer screening and treatment?
What are the cultural beliefs that influence health-seeking behaviors and outcome for women at risk of getting breast cancer?
1.6; SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY
This study provides an insight into breast cancer determinants in women of reproductive age within the context of rural Kenya where information is sparse. The findings will contribute to the existing evidence about the epidemiology of breast cancer in low and middle income nations and inform the design of intervention strategies in a bid to counteract the burden of disease. The study will raise awareness of breast cancer among women in Sigowet Soin Sub-county which can lead to earlier presentation and better outcomes. Finally the study findings will be useful in policy makers, health practitioners and non-governmental organizations (NGO`s) in planning and executing effective breast cancer  prevention and control programs in similar settings.
1.7; SCOPE OF THE STUDY
This study will focus on identifying and analyzing the determinants associated with breast cancer among women of reproductive age attending Soin Sigowet Sub County Hospital in Kericho county,  Kenya. The target population includes women of reproductive age who attend the hospital for any medical service, including screening, treatment or consultation. Health professionals at the hospital may also be consulted for supplementary qualitative data on health education, screening practices and diagnosis trends. The study will be conducted within Soin Sigowet Sub County Hospital located in Kericho county in rift valley region of Kenya. The hospital is selected due to its central role in providing health care service to a wide rural and peri-urban population make it suitable for assessing public health concerns such as breast cancer. The data collection will be conducted from May 2025 to August 2025 a period of four months. Retrospective data (such as from hospital records and registries) and cross-sectional data(such as through surveys and interviews) may be used. The study will explore demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, reproductive factors that may be associated with the risk or incidence of breast cancer. Key variables may include; age, parity, age at first pregnancy, contraceptive use, family history of breast cancer, alcohol use, physical inactivity, obesity, breastfeeding practices and awareness levels about breast cancer. The study will also consider access to screening, early detection and treatment options and how these relate to the stage at diagnosis. The research uses mixed-methods approach, incorporating both quantitative (surveys, hospital data) and qualitative (interviews, focus groups) methods. Ethical approval will be obtained and informed consent will be required from all participants.
1.8; LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY
The study is limited to one health facility and may not be generalizable to all women in Kericho county. Since it focuses only on reproductive-age women, it excludes postmenopausal women who are also at risk of developing breast cancer. Availability and accuracy of hospital records may impact the reliability of secondary data. 
CHAPTER TWO; LITERATURE REVIEW
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide accounting for over 2.3 million new cases annually(WHO 2021). In Sub Saharan Africa ,breast cancer incidence is rising due to lifestyle changes and lack of early detection programs (Jedy Agba et al.,2016). In Kenya, breast cancer is the leading cancer among women, contributing significantly to cancer-related deaths(Kenya Ministry of Health,2019). Lifestyle behaviors such as diet, physical activity, alcohol consumption and obesity has been increasingly linked to breast cancer.In Western Kenya,sedentary lifestyle and high fat diet significantly increase breast cancer risk(Mutua et al.,2021). Obesity especially among women aged 25-45, alters hormonal balance increasing estrogen levels, which contribute to breast cancer development(Otieno et al.,2022). Alcohol intake and smoking though less common among rural women,are rising due to urban influence and have carcinogenic effects on breast tissue(Wekesa et al.,2023). Low fruit and vegetable intake compounded by limited nutrition awareness is also contributing to risk among reproductive aged women. Delayed diagnosis remains a key contributor to poor breast cancer outcomes in Kenya. In Kericho County over 70% of women presented with late stage disease(Ngeno et al.,2024). In rural areas there is inaccessibility of screening services such as mammography or biopsy facilities, screening and treatment are unaffordable for many especially those without insurance cover, shortage of trained personelle  which limits effective clinical breast examination and poor referrals system affects timely and effective breast cancer screening and treatment. Health system insufficiencies are a major bottleneck in timely breast cancer care especially in sub county hospitals(KEMRI.,2022). Cultural perceptions of cancer significantly affects how women respond to breast health. In Kericho and broader Rift Valley regions, breast cancer is often viewed as a curse or spiritual punishment (Muthoni and Miller.,2021). This leads to a preference for traditional healers over hospital visits especially during early symptoms. Fear of mastectomy believed to reduce feminity or marital value , further discourages early medical consultation. Modesty norms also prevent some women from undergoing breast exam , particularly with male clinicians(Kebaya et al.,2022). Additionally, some women believe that a cancer diagnosis equals death, reinforcing denial and delayed health-seeking behavior.In Soin Sigowet Sub County settings, lifestyle choices, cultural beliefs and systemic barriers all interact to influence disease onset, diagnosis and outcomes. Addressing these factors requires integrated strategies that combine community education, affordable screening access and culturally sensitive care models.
